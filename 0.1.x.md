## Fields

- [`spec`](#spec)
- [`time`](#time)
- [`value`](#value)
- [`name`](#name)
- [`domain`](#domain)
- [`revision`](#revision)
- [`version`](#version)
- [`labels`](#labels)
- [`refs`](#refs)
- [`meta`](#meta)

### `spec`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: string

The [semantic version](http://semver.org) of the specification the fact was produced against.

This is to ensure consumers can check for compatibility when consuming a fact.


### `time`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: integer

A [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamp in nanoseconds.

The `time` denotes when the [value](#value) was asserted and therefore valid. Subsequent facts that assert a value for the same [entity](#name) implicitly invalidates the previous values.


### `value`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: any type

The value of an entity being asserted.

A value is, by definition, immutable. If assigned to an [entity](#name), this is referred to as the *state* of the entity at the associated time.


### `name`

- Required: No
- Type: string
- Regexp: `^([a-z])([a-z][0-9]-._)*$`

The name of the entity the [value](#value) is assigned to.

Together the [`domain`](#domain) and `name` define the *identity* of the entity.


### `domain`

- Required: No
- Type: string
- Regexp: `^([a-z])([a-z][0-9]-._)*$`

The domain the [name](#name) is uniquely defined in.

If the [`name`](#name) is defined, the `domain` must be defined as well. Together the `domain` and [`name`](#name) define the *identity* of the entity. 


### `revision`

- Required: No
- Type: string

The revision of the [entity](#name) for the current [value](#value).

The revision string must have a [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) to state. A good example of this behavior are [Git commit hashes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#Commit-Objects).


### `version`

- Required: No
- Type: string

The [release version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) of the [entity](#name) the current state is associated with.

This must be a valid [semantic version](http://semver.org).


### `labels`

- Required: No
- Type: set of strings

Labels are used to classify the entity or value if assigned.


### `refs`

- Required: No
- Type: map of references

`refs` are used to model relationships to other entities.

At a minimum, a reference defines the `domain` and `name` of the entity it is referencing. The `time`, `revision`, and/or `version` field may be included to increase the specificity of the reference. A `revision` is the most granular since it has a one-to-one correspondence to a particular state. Specifying a `time` will result in a value that is the *closest, but not exceeding* the reference time. A `version` will result in the latest value assigned to the version.

The `type` field can be defined for declaring the semantics of the relationship. The motiviation for this is to make it possible to express lineage. The current types are:

- `dependence` - Denotes the entity (in this state) has a dependence on the reference value.
- `derivation` - Denotes the entity was derived from the reference value.
- `replacement` - Denotes the entity replaces the reference.

### `meta`

- Required: No
- Type: map

The `meta` field is a map of additional information about the fact.

No explicit semantics have been defined for this field.


## Encoding

[MsgPack](http://msgpack.org) is the chosen encoder because has a balance of flexibility and performance. In addition, there are over [50 MsgPack implementations](http://msgpack.org/#languages) for a variety of languages. In addition, JSON can be easily converted to a MsgPack representation.

Table of specific types for each encoder.

Field | MsgPack | JSON
------|---------|-----
`spec` | `fixstr` | `string`
`time` | `uint64` | `number`
`value` | Any MsgPack type | Any JSON type
`name` | `str8` | `string`
`domain` | `str8` | `string`
`revision` | `str8` `string`
`version` | `fixstr` | `string`
`labels` | `fixarray` | `array`
`refs` | `map16` | `object`
`meta` | `map16` | `object`
